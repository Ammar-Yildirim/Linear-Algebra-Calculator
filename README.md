# Java-Project
In this project I aimed to use my Linear Algebra, OOP, and Basic Java knowledge to come up with a program that calculates Gaussian Elimination. It comes with structural and functional tests. 

Simply write compile.bat into the terminal to compile all necessary files and run the test-suite.
